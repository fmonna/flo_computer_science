A go at comparing my implementations of stuff in different languages

I've implemented various things in different programming languages.
I've often wondered how they look when put side by side.

Over the years, I've used C, C++, Python, Fortran, Rust, and other languages
you won't find here. Not every item is implemented in every single one of those
languages.

This repository arborescence is directly inspired by the Computer Science
roadmap from [https://roadmap.sh/computer-science].
