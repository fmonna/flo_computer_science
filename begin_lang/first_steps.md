# First steps

I created this repository when I started to learn Rust, and wanted to brush up
on my old programming languages along the way. 

This directory follows the first steps of the book on the Rust programming
Language [https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-00-getting-started.html]

* Install programming language on your operating system
* Write a "Hello, world!" program
* Use said programming language package manager (if it exists), and build

## Installation
I use macOS and Linux at home, so this should work on at least one of them.

C, C++ and Python were already installed at the time of creation of this repo,
so I only needed to install Rust 

$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

## Hello, World!
* See hello_world directory
